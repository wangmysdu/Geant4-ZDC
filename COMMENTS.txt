- Keep magnetic field ? (Will be in tracker)
- What to do with vis.tutor?
- RANDOM NUMBERS HANDLING - keep it here?

- Add fiber, hole, reflector, SiPM and others for WSci.
- Energy deposition of each module(total + scintillator) is stored.  
- The Shashlik detector signal is divided to two separate segmentations.

- Chagne variable name from "SiPM" to "Sipm", "EmC" to "Emc".
- Fix scintillation light bug that no scintillation light is generated.
- Add SiPM/PMT photons readout with the "SiPMSD" sensitive detector method.
- Suggest to use smaller value of scintillation light yield for fast simulation, the actual light yield of PbWO4 400/MeV and plastic scintillator 8000/MeV.
- NPE is stored for each detector array and each module of array separately.
